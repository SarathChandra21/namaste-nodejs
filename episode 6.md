# libuv async IO

JS is a synchronous single threaded language    

Libuv connects the os(file, DB, APIs, Timer etc..) with JS engine (It has so many asynchronous powers)

Async I/O is made simple using Libuv(it is a C Library)

Nodejs is async because of Libuv.

Nodejs is Asynchronous I/O (Non Blocking I/O)
